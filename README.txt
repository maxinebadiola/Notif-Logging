HCI2001 Notif Interaction Experiment 

Good day! We are Computer Science students from DLSU Manila, and for our Human Computer Interactions (HCI2001) class, we are conducting an experiment related to user interactions with notifications of varying behavior and design.

Our goal is to determine certain aspects of notification design that could potentially enhance user experience. The insights you provide after participating in our experiment would be extremely helpful for us to better understand the data we’ve collected and draw meaningful conclusions.

For this experiment, you will need a handheld device (iPad or Tablet). You will be playing a game of Simon Says, while playing a notification will randomly appear. 
You may choose to Accept, Dismiss, or Ignore the notifications. 
The notifications will be of varying categories and color.

Please open this link for the experiment website: https://maxinebadiola.github.io/notification-interaction/

How to perform experiment: 
1. Select which notificaiton behaviour to simulate: Urgent or Non-Urgent
2. After enough data has been collected for this experiment, an alert will appear allowing you to download the results as a .csv file.
3. Download the .csv file. 

Kindly perform Steps 1-3 for EACH notification behaviour 2 times. 
This means you should have a total of 4 .csv files containing the results of the experiment (2 for Urgent Notification Behaviour, 2 for Non-Urgent Notification Behaviour).

Once you have the required 4 result files, kindly answer the form: https://forms.gle/7x2jEjEFuRot4grQ6
At the end of the form, please upload the 4 .csv files.

Thank you for your participation!
